/// A type representing a node in a linked list of lambdas that generates a data
/// structure. Returns a bool indicating whether or not the supplied string is a
/// member of the data structure, i.e. contained by the current node or one it
/// is linked to.
///
/// This data type does not allow inspection of particular nodes, so the data
/// type is completely opaque to users. There is no way to determine things like
/// the index of an element in a list of Nodes or the size of a collection of
/// Nodes.

	/// The function that actually does work. Returns true if this Node contains
	/// the supplied value or if any linked Nodes further down the chain do.
	typealias Node = (T) -> Bool
	
	/// The empty node, which always returns false, no matter the input. Has to
	/// be a function because generics can't be stored in static properties.
