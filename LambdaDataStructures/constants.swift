/// structure. Returns a bool indicating whether or not the supplied string is a
/// member of the data structure, i.e. contained by the current node or one it
/// is linked to.

/// This data type does not allow inspection of particular nodes, so the data
/// type is completely opaque to users. There is no way to determine things like
/// the index of an element in a list of Nodes or the size of a collection of
/// Nodes.
