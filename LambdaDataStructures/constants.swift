/// A type representing a node in a linked list of lambdas that generates a data
/// structure. Returns a bool indicating whether or not the supplied string is a
/// member of the data structure, i.e. contained by the current node or one it
/// is linked to.
///
/// This data type does not allow inspection of particular nodes, so the data
/// type is completely opaque to users. There is no way to determine things like
/// the index of an element in a list of Nodes or the size of a collection of
/// Nodes.

/// The typical elements all example collections are comprised of.
let kElements = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

/// The empty node always returns false, no matter the input.
let kEmptyNode: Node = { str in
	return false
}

/// Asserts that all elements are in the given collection. Causes a runtime
/// failure if that isn't the case.
